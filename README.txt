I converted the puzzle structure into a flat list of pieces
and matricies.  I got rid of piece sets. This greatly simplyfied
this code. I also got rid of manually specifying permutations.
Moves are specified by listing affected pieces, and rotation axis/angle.
Permutations are autmomatically generated by comparing matricies.
States are not very light weight and applying a move or sequence of moves
is a simple permutation of the state array.





The only real file that changes between puzzles is the single js file.
The only difference between the html files is which js file gets included.
I need to figure out a menu to select a puzzle. 



TODO:
- Fix scroll event position issue (not translating to wbgl window right).
- Finish converting Tetra3
- Debug why pick and drag is choosing the wrong moves.
  I have added an extra comparison that forces moves to be picked on
  faces perpendicular to the axis of rotation.
- Add a constraint so the search mill not visit the minimum state found so far.
  I already tried avoiding choosing the reverse move from the parent.
  I Id did not work completely.
- Make sure equivalent sequences are not added.
- Add reverse sequences when expanding symmetries.
- Make a puzzle that replicates Gwenda's gold gift.
