The only real file that changes between puzzles is the single js file.
The only difference between the html files is which js file gets included.
I need to figure out a menu to select a puzzle. 





// Things todo:
// Normal maps / lighting.
// Write a program to seach for moves that make minimal changes.
// Write a way to save macro moves.
// Write a way to apply macro moves relative to a face/view.
// Write a way to intuitively display macro moves:
//   Unchanged pieces are white.  Arrows to show permutation.
// Write a method to solve a puzzle using macro moves. (All down hill).
// Stop the rendering (tick) when nothing changes.
